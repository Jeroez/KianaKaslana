        <p class="Para SixthPara"></p>

        <h1 class="Title SeventhTitle">&emsp;Herrscher of Flamescion</h1>
        <p class="Para SeventhPara">After beating the Herrscher persona within her, and saying a final goodbye to Himeko, Kiana had to face one of the toughest battles she will face. It was Kiana Kaslana against thousands of puppets and the seemingly unbeatable Herrscher of Dominance and even though she was the one fighting the Herrscher head-on, she had the power of others supporting her. This fight showcased how much Kiana has grown since the beginning of the story. She has experienced pain, guilt, regret, loss, and everything that would've pushed a normal person into the darkness with no way out, but she was able to push through and become a great force to be reckoned with. After Fu Hua and Bronya had no more energy left in them, Kiana fought for her life and for all the others that helped and supported her. Mei, Bronya, Fu Hua, Theresa, Anti-Entropy, everyone on the Hyperion, all the innocent lives she saved and will save in the future, and most importantly her teacher Himeko. They all gave her the power to awaken as the Herrscher of Flamescion and give her that final push to bring out the flames and deal the final blow to the Herrscher of Dominance. The flames that she now wields will be everlasting, nothing will be able to put out the strong fire in her heart to save this world.</p>

        <h1 class="Title EightTitle">&emsp;Herrscher of Finality</h1>
        <p class="Para EightPara">This is it everyone, this is the final stretch. After so many hardships, pains, emotions, fun moments, and tears we get to see Kiana become the Herrscher of Finality and fight off Kevin with Bronya and Mei to save the world from Project Stigma and maybe even from the Honkai too. After Mei became the Herrscher of Origin, the trio worked to each be able to become the Herrscher of Finality using Kiana as the bridge that connects them all. Kiana worked to understand the concepts, of Origin, Thunder, Reason, Truth, and Sentience together with the powers of Void and Flamescion to fuse more than half of the Herrscher powers of this world and make them become interconnected. Kiana ends up being chosen by the Cocoon of Finality and proceeds to travel through a space where she meets all the places Herrschers were born and their authorities. It was a trip down memory lane and we got to see Kiana walk through every place we've seen in this long journey. And finally, after getting flashbacks from multiple Herrscher memories, and being pushed on by Mei, Bronya, and all the other Herrschers, she reaches the Cocoon of Finality and becomes the Herrscher of Finality. She encounters a mysterious being who asks her the most important question, "who are you?" Kiana answered the best way she possibly could. "I am Kiana Kaslana, an ordinary Valkyrie. I am also K-423, a test subject created by Otto. I can also be considered an extension of Sirin. Of course, along with those, I am also Siegfried's daughter, Theresa's niece, Durandal's younger sister, Himeko's student, and a friend of Mei, Bronya, Fu Hua, and others. And Also Kevin's descendant." The being then asked, "Why did you come?" Kiana started at the start, all the way from wanting to find her dad, to wanting to become the strongest S-Rank Valkyrie, wanting to turn back time after leaving school, but now, she wishes to bring this imperfect story closer to perfection and be the lightning bolt that strikes the tree by being humanities first stepping stone at fighting the Honkai. "Why do you want to do this?" "Because this world raised me." Kiana pours her heart out for the final question and mentions how thankful she was to everyone in this world for multiple reasons. This mysterious being was actually Kiana's true self who she had to face before finally being qualified for Finality. They can finally fight Kevin on equal footing and stop Project Stigma from hurting the Earth further.</p>
